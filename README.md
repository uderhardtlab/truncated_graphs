# Effects of truncation on centrality measures

## Correction methods:
1) Boundary correction:
  - insert "ghost" edges or nodes around the boundaries (by mirroring, incorporation prior knowledge etc.)
3) Bootstrapping#
  - sample subnetworks from the inner part of the network and compare to whole network results
5) Sensitivity analysis
  - systematically vary image size and measure effects
7) Normalization
  - local network density, harmonic centrality
